# Cards_of_Cellarium
Adaptation of the party game Mafia, utilizing cards instead of abilities based on role.  Peer to peer networking is used to play locally.
Utilizes JavaFX for the GUI and all of the Java sockets and clients systems.

Includes:
  1. 3 separate groups with their own set of ability cards to use and draw
  2. Some unique roles under the Neutral group that have their own special cards
  3. In-game chat that all players can use, and special chats during the night time cycle of the game
  4. Peer-to-Peer networking used for all the local online play
  5. Full GUI with names per player
  6. Timers are shared between players and updated by the server/host
Lacking:
  1. Non-local online play
  2. Better variety of cards
  3. More stable networking with less desyncronization
  4. Timers aren't very well made
  5. More artwork and better design for the GUI
